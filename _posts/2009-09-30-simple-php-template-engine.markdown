  the same features without throwing another template syntax on top of what PHP already
  does.  You can still achieve the separation needed with a simple class (shown at

  content: This example gave me the necessary foundation to understand the concept
    behind template engines. It's very simple and easy to approach. I plan on using
    something similar to it in my backend's next version. Are there any stipulations
    on using this code?

  content: "There is a small problem with your Template class when using arrays. \r\n\r\nTry
    this:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n$view-&gt;a = array('foo');\r\nvar_dump($view-&gt;a); //foo

    is not there!\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nTo solve this, you need to return the __get by
    reference, like this:\r\n\r\n[code]\r\npublic function &amp;__get($name){\r\n
    \ if (isset($this-&gt;vars[$name])) return $this-&gt;vars[$name]; \r\n  else return
    null;\r\n}\t\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nIt's also advisable to overload isset and unset\r\n\r\n[code]\r\npublic
    function __isset($name) {        \r\n  return isset($this-&gt;vars[$name]);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic
    function __unset($name) {\r\n  unset($this-&gt;vars[$name]);\r\n}\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    but you also have access to functions (@see view helpers like Zend_View_Helper)
    through the __call magic function inside of your Template class.\r\n\r\nAll and

    write another article sometime showing how to do it.

    to why you think that assigning into properties \"breaks the OO\".   A complicated
    structure like a table of results doesn't really add, or take away any complexity
    in the template.  You can still assign the value into the scope of the template,
    and then loop over it the same way you would in PHP.  Even do nested looping!"

  content: "<a href=\"#comment-8488\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Ben </a> \r\nThere's several
    ways you can do this.  You can just assign a multi dimensional array into the
    template and loop over it like you normally would.\r\n\r\nThe other way I've been
    thinking about doing a blog about... Using the SPL to make a sort of \"lazy iterator\"
    so that the values of the array aren't filled out until you loop over them.  You
    can simply just assign the object into the view.  As you loop over object, it
    will get the data you need."

  content: "Faith is knowledge ... and in the wrong hands it can be very painful.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the major drawbacks to your argument (which I understand being - the use of
    Smarty is redundant) Is without a different template language, or rules in place
    to stop biz logic seeping into presentation code - your asking for trouble.\r\n\r\nYou
    can cache/compile any of these so-called \"redundant\" layers without affecting
    other layers of your code. If your building a little percy website, by all means
    use PHP for both templates and backend code, but if you don't have rules and enough
    discipline in place to prevent application seepage between these layers on a large
    scale project - your asking for trouble!\r\n\r\nAnother point about OO in front
    end code. Ask yourself, what tools do you really need for the presentation layer?
    Repeating groups ... conditional statements ... That's actually about it. If your
    thinking of something more complicated, you probably have your biz logic in the
    wrong place. The only exception to this I would suggest are view helpers.\r\n\r\nSo
    KISS in this case is adding layers to your apps - NO KISS are for people who us
    a sledgehammer for everything."

<h3>PHP for templating?</h3>

PHP is a bit of a rare language as it can already template into text in markup with zero modifications or libraries.  It is probably one of the big contributing factors why PHP is one of the most popular languages on the web today.  (Can't be the only factor, it didn't work for ColdFusion)  Most other web languages have a one or more templating languages with a different syntax that need to be learned on top of the implementing language.  PHP lowers the bar to entry by allowing you to put your PHP code right into your html.  But as we all know, sometime in your PHP tour, you will realize the need to separate presentation logic and the application logic.  Some developers go running to some other solution that provides a different syntax.  I am a bit puzzled on why this seems to be common practice, PHP can provide the same features without throwing another template syntax on top of what PHP already does.  You can still achieve the separation needed with a simple class (shown at the end of this article).

<!--MORE-->

<p>I mainly see two solutions that people tend to use over PHP.  One solution is to use a premade template engine like Smarty on top of PHP.  The other is to use string replacement techniques on a template file.</p>
<h3>String replacement... sucks</h3>
<p>If you wrote your own template engine most likely using a <i>str_replace</i> or perhaps <i>preg_replace</i> to implement the embedding of dynamic parts of the code.  There are two problems with this:  One, it's slow;  Secondly it's difficult to implement all the features needed to provide a robust templating language.  Things like formatting functions, control structures etc are a bit clumsy to add to a solution like this.  The other option is to implement very simple variable replacement, and then doing your formatting functions, control structures, etc. in your controller and just assign the result to variable replacement, however, that is completely against the point of having a template engine. The separation of presentation logic and app logic gets pretty blurry when you do some of the presentation logic outside of the template.</p>
<p>Did I mention it's a pretty slow solution?</p>
<h3>Smarty and other template engines</h3>
<p>Smarty and similar template engines are pretty darn redundant.  Here is an example of the workflow for Smarty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smarty language is parsed</li>
<li>Compiled to PHP</li>
<li>PHP code is cached</li>
<li>PHP code is parsed</li>
<li>PHP code is compiled to opcodes</li>
<li>If you have a opcode cache, opcodes are cached</li>
<li>opcodes are ran</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't see the redundancy there, I'm not doing my job very well.  The whole idea of Smarty is like having a car on top of a car and believing it improves your gas mileage. Most people complain that the Smarty syntax is better than PHP's for templating. Bull.  There is nothing really gained in Smarty's syntax, it only looks more concise, but in reality there is not enough gains to support having the bloat on top of PHP. You save a couple of keystrokes, big deal. <kbd>{$var}</kbd> vs. <kbd>&lt;?=$var?&gt;</kbd>. That is micro-optimization if I ever saw it.  PHP control structres and formatting are much more concise and cleaner looking than Smarty's.  Smarty doesn't work with most IDE's, so with PHP you gain everything you get with your IDE (or editor), code completion, highlighting, syntax linting, and more!</p>
<h3>common (lame) excuses</h3>
<h4>My designers don't know PHP</h4>
<p>They also don't know the templating language you pick for them.  If they are going to learn something, have them just learn enough PHP to do their templating.  The syntax of something like smarty isn't really easier to learn at all.</p>
<h4>I can't use PHP! that's not separating the presentation logic!</h4>
<p>Actually you can achieve clear separation.  See the class code below.</p>
<h4>PHP syntax sucks for Templating</h4>
<p>No, it's just fine.  Really.</p>
<h4>I don't trust my designers with PHP</h4>
<p>You are using a templating engine to solve the wrong problem.  Template engines are meant to achieve higher maintainability through separation of logic.  What you are trying to solve is a flaw in your job culture.  These days, designers don't need to write bad server side code to cause a lot of hurt, they can write some horrid client side code that can be just as bad.  Also your templating engine should be flexible in case you run into a wall in implementation.  You don't want to paint yourself in a architectural corner because you don't do code review. (if you really don't trust your designers, only let them make static html mockups, have a jr. developer make them into templates.)</p>
<h4>I don't like PHP</h4>
<p>Me either, that's why I work with Java and JSP.</p>
<h2>The Code:</h2>

{%  highlight php %}
<?php
class Template {
  private $vars  = array();

  public function __get($name) {
    return $this->vars[$name];
  }

  public function __set($name, $value) {
    $this->vars[$name] = $value;
  }

  public function render($view_template_file) {
    extract($this->vars, EXTR_SKIP);
    ob_start();
    include($view_template_file);
    return ob_get_clean();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Usage:</p>
<p>main.php template:</p>

{% highlight html+php %}
<html>
<head>
    <title><?php echo $title; ?></title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>
    <div>
        <?php echo $content; ?>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>content.php:</p>

{% highlight html+php %}
<ul>
    <?php foreach($links as $link): ?>
        <li><?php echo $link; ?></li>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
<div>
    <?php echo $body; ?>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>controller.php:</p>

{% highlight php startinline %}
$view = new Template();

$view->title = "hello, world";
$view->links = array("one", "two", "three");
$view->body = "Hi, sup";

$view->content = $view->render('content.php');
echo $view->render('main.php');
{% endhighlight %}

<p><b>*EDIT*</b> Added checks to make sure that no one tries to binding a variable named view_template_file to prevent somone doing something silly and bind the whole request to the function overriding the variable. Causing a nasty vulnerability</p>
